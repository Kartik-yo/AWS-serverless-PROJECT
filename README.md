## About
The AWS Serverless Projects repository is designed to help developers:
- Understand serverless architecture concepts.
- Explore hands-on implementations using AWS services.
- Gain insights into practical serverless solutions for real-world problems.

Each project in this repository is self-contained with its own documentation and deployment guide.

##Setup and Deployment

Follow these steps to set up and deploy any project in this repository:

Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kartik-yo/AWS-serverless-PROJECTS.git
cd AWS-serverless-PROJECTS
```
Navigate to a Project:
```
cd project-name
```
Install Dependencies: If the project uses npm, install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Deploy the Project: Use AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework to deploy:

Using AWS SAM:
```
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```
Using the Serverless Framework:
```
serverless deploy
```
Test the Deployment:

- Verify API Gateway endpoints, Lambda functions, or other resources in the AWS Console.
- Follow testing instructions in the project-specific README.md.

## Technologies Used:
The repository uses the following technologies and services:

- AWS Lambda: For executing serverless functions.
- Amazon API Gateway: To create RESTful APIs.
- Amazon DynamoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- Amazon S3: For hosting static content and storing objects.
- AWS CloudFormation: Infrastructure as code for resource provisioning.
- AWS SAM: Simplifies deployment and management of serverless applications.
- Node.js: For backend logic and handling serverless functions.
