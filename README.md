# Serverless Image Processing Application

This project demonstrates a serverless application that allows users to upload images to an S3 bucket and apply various image processing techniques using AWS Lambda. The solution uses AWS services to provide a scalable and cost-effective image processing pipeline.

---

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload images via a REST API endpoint.
- **Image Processing**: Apply transformations or effects to uploaded images using serverless functions.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes AWS services like Lambda and S3 to handle varying workloads seamlessly.

---

## Technologies Used

- **AWS S3**: Stores the uploaded and processed images.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes the image processing tasks.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Routes HTTP requests to the serverless backend.
- **Terraform**: Manages infrastructure as code (IaC) for deploying resources.
- **Python/Node.js**: Programming languages used for Lambda functions.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure it with appropriate credentials.
2. **Terraform CLI**: Install Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
3. **Python or Node.js**: Ensure you have the required runtime environment for the Lambda functions.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kartik-yo/AWS-serverless-PROJECT.git
   cd AWS-serverless-PROJECT
2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Navigate to the terraform directory and initialize Terraform.
```
cd terraform
terraform init
```
3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   Deploy the required AWS resources using Terraform.

```
terraform apply

```
4. **Set Up Lambda Functions**:

Add your image processing logic in the lambda/ directory.
Deploy the Lambda function via the AWS Console or CLI.

## Test the Application:

- Use the API Gateway endpoint to upload an image.
- Verify the processed image in the designated S3 bucket.

## Usage

- Upload an Image: Send a POST request with an image file to the API Gateway endpoint.
- Processing: AWS Lambda processes the uploaded image and applies the configured transformations.
- Retrieve Processed Image: Processed images are saved in a separate folder within the same S3 bucket.
